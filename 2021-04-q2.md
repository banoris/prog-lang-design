# Question 2: Typechecker

## A. State

Note: adapted from my lab2 typechecker.

1. `Sig` - a finite map from function identifiers (function name) to function signatures, 2-tuple of: (list of `FunArg`'s type, function's return type). Read-only after initialized
2. `Context` - A finite map from variable indentifer to its type
3. `Env` - a 2-tuple of (Sig, [Context]).

The typechecker may throw TypeError exception when it detect type mismatch.

## B. Initialization and run

The typechecker takes the AST of Lovelace. Parse all `FunDef` and populate `Sig` appropriately. Ensure no naming collision between function names, as well as between main variables. Also, ensure that no duplicate `FunArg` declared and each of arguments satisfy the type based on the function declaration. The name for local arguments of function also must be unique and does not collides with the name of the function arguments. Loop through each FunDef and main `Body`, add declared variables to `Context`, do type-check as per section C below.

## C. Syntax-directed traversal

I'll explain this based on each `Stm` and `Exp`. How typecheck is done given an expression and type is explained in section D.

`SReturn e` - check the type for expression e, and check that it matches the function return type from `Sig`. If type mismatch, throw TypeError

`SAssign x e` - First, get the type of variable `x` from `Context`. Next, check type of `e`. If `x` not found or type mismatch, throw TypeError

`SIf e1 s1 s2` - check type for expression `e1`, ensure it is of type 

`SWhile e ss` - check type for expression `e`, ensure it is type Boolean. If type mismatch, throw TypeError.

`SFor x e1 e2 ss` - Add variable `x` to a new context. Also, check type for both expression `e1` and `e2`, ensure it is Integer. Any type mismatch, throw TypeError. Upon exiting for loop, pop off a stack from list of `Context`

`SPut e` - check type for expression `e`, ensure it is Integer. If type mismatch, throw TypeError

`ECall id es` - Get function signature of `id` from `Sig`, if not found, throw error. Ensure the length of `es` matches the length of `FunArg`s of that function. Also, check the type for each expression in `es`, and ensure that the type matches the corresponding function argument. Each `EVar` expression also must exist in `Context`. Any issue or type mismatch, throw TypeError.

`EMul e1 mulop e2` - check the type for both expression `e1` and `e2`, ensure that both are Integer. Any type mismatch, throw TypeError.

`EAdd e1 AddOp e2` - check the type for both expression `e1` and `e2`, ensure that both are Integer. Any type mismatch, throw TypeError.

`ECmp e1 CmpOp e2` - check the type for both expression `e1` and `e2`, ensure that both are Integer. Any type mismatch, throw TypeError.

`EJunct e1 JunctOp e2` - check the type for both expression `e1` and `e2`, ensure that both are Boolean. Any type mismatch, throw TypeError. 

Note: any variable access (EVar expression) not found in `Context` will throw error as well. 

## D. API

`checkExp(e, t)` - given expression `e`, check whether it is of type `t`. Return true/false. Example:
```
checkExp(EInt i, t)
    t == TInteger

checkExp(EBool b, t)
    t == TBool

-- add operation, both operands must be of type Integer
checkExp(EAdd e1 AddOp e2, Integer)
    checkExp(e1, Integer) && checkExp(e2, Integer)

checkExp(EJunct e1 JunctOp e2, Boolean):
    checkExp(e1, Boolean) && checkExp(e2, Boolean)

```
